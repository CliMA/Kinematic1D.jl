# Kinematic1D.jl

Kinematic1D.jl is a single column, prescribed flow driver for testing microphysics schemes.
It uses
  [ClimaCore.jl](https://github.com/CliMA/ClimaCore.jl) operators and
  [CloudMicrophysics.jl](https://github.com/CliMA/CloudMicrophysics.jl) tendencies
  to create the numerical problem that is then solved using
  [OrdinaryDiffEq.jl](https://github.com/SciML/OrdinaryDiffEq.jl).

## Simulation setup

The setup is based on the kinematic framework introduced by [KiD2012](@cite):
Vertical momentum flux is constant with height and varying in time.
Density and temerature profiles are constant and defined by the initial
  condition, which is unsaturated.
As the simulation progresses in time moisture is transported upwards,
  supersaturation grows in the upper part of the domain
  and precipitation is formed.
In the second part of the simulation the vertical momentum flux is switched off,
  leaving only cloud microphysics tendencies acting to change
  the model state.
Below figure shows an example prescribed vertical momentum as a function of time.

```@example example_figure
using Plots
include("../../src/driveKiD/helper_functions.jl")

t_range = range(0, 15 * 60, length=100)
w1 = 2.0
t1 = 600.0
plot(t_range / 60.0, [œÅw_helper(t, w1, t1) for t in t_range], linewidth=3, xlabel="t [min]", ylabel="updraft momentum flux [m/s kg/m3]")

## Changes to CliMA defaults

One of the goals of Kinematic1D.jl
  is to test against [PySDM](https://github.com/atmos-cloud-sim-uj/PySDM)
  and the particle-based implementation of the kinematic model available in
  [PySDM-examples](https://github.com/atmos-cloud-sim-uj/PySDM-examples).
As a result, some CliMA constants were changed from their default values to better match PySDM:
